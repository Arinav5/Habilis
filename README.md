# Habilis
Routine Building Application
Note: You probably can't run this file because it has an SQL database and I don't yet know how to make that work on github. 

Purpose: Habilis is a routine building application that helps people build routines they'll actually stick to.
How it works: The user creates tasks they have to follow and adds them to their daily routine. Then the user has to check in everyday to describe what tasks they did and didn't do. As certain tasks get missed over time they will be removed from the current routine and get waitlisted. When the user is comfortable with their current routine they can add back the tasks that were previously removed. In the end they should end up with the original routine.
